Survey
Make an app that lets people design and take surveys. Here are some user stories:

As a survey designer, I want to create a new survey, so that I can get people's opinion on important matters.
As a survey designer, I want to add questions to my survey, so that I can find out what people think about them.
As a survey designer, I want to add possible responses to each question, so that I can structure people's opinions into discrete choices that they must choose among. At this point, I want all questions to be multiple-choice, pick one.
As a survey taker, I want to be able to choose what survey to take, so that I can give the surveyor my opinion.
As a survey taker, I want to view one question at a time, so that I don't get distracted by the other ones.
As a survey taker, I want to be able to choose among the possible responses for each question, so that I can actually input my opinion.
As a survey designer, I want to view the number and percentage of respondents who picked each possible response to each question, so that I can see the results of my survey.
As a survey designer, I want to have the option to let respondents choose multiple answers for each question, so that I can have questions like "Choose all of the programming languages you know."
As a survey designer, I want to have open-ended questions, so that I can ask questions like "Please explain why you chose to become a programmer."
As a survey designer, I want to let respondents choose "Other" for some questions, so that they can input their own choice if my choices aren't sufficient.
